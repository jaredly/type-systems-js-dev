Feedbacks:
- what do i mwan by better programmer
  - by the way, when you come back to your code
- maybe (javascript) programmer
- eslint (don't need to say "popular linter")
- "writing simple code"
  - non-clever
  - maybe say non-clever instead of "simple"
  here's an example of doing things too clever
  -> `on + (b ? 'click' : 'mousedown')`
- closing line of the "here's flow" section, let's all use this! it's the best
  stuff

Ben:
- super practical (maybe say "how to get started")
  - maybe "here's a link to how to get started"
- more code examples, more screenshots, more error messages
- with "these are bad js behaviors", maybe circle back w/ what flow would say
- insert a slide after "helpful / not helpful" - "js tries to be helpful &
  guess what you meant. this actually makes it harder to diagnose problems" --
  because if the machine needs to figure it out, that means the next coder
  coming in will need to figure out
- "what is a function you can't type in flow"
  - show code snippet
- underlying theme "flow should play better w/ react"
- instroduce the concept of static type checking as a way to catch bugs
  - they're like lint in development experience
  - but like runtime checks in comprehensiveness
- maybe say "i'm gonna give you
- add comments "// data might be null here" > RealContentWithDataLoaded
- loading | answering | finished
  - show me three application screens
  - show that the three states now map to
- maybe add an example of what a tagged union might help you catch.
  - if you're trying to use the wrong stuff
  - "would you rather be debugging it now or later"
